Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Exploration

Overview

This project explores the implementation and training process of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) as part of a deep learning study and presentation.

The goal was to understand the adversarial training dynamic between a generator and a discriminator model and how GANs can learn to produce synthetic data samples.
